     And that's all there is for today!<br /><br />All I did today really was mess with pyCast...<br /><br />It's going Reeeally well though, I got plenty of code working and fixed, mainly my RSS grabbing code. Next I download the damned podcasts :)<br />I made a silly little roadmap too, I might upload it when I stick 0.1/0.2 on my site.<br /><br />Thats all for now, time to get back to it..<br /><br />iphitus<br />

     Well yeah, its the new year!<br /><br />Well, at least I was on time... like any decent person I sync my computer to an NTP atomic clock time server. My neighbour obviously doesnt, I could hear their new years party was a few minutes late.......<br /><br />I'm tired..... so that's all...... <span style="font-weight: bold;">for now......</span><br /><br />iphitus<br />

     well, its here, so im going to make a cliche blog!<br />It's just past midnight... soooo<br /><br /><a href="http://mandrakeusers.org/index.php?showtopic=21750&view=findpost&amp;p=163372">Happy New Year!</a><br /><br />It's nearly 1am, so I figure I may as well get some new years resolutions done :D<br /><ul>   <li>I'm not going to waste my time  - I will use it for something.</li>   <li>I will work on my school work - I need to, VCE starts and im stuffed if I dont.</li>   <li>I will keep this blog up to date - I've tried in the past and failed, I want to get it goin this time!</li>   <li>I want to start contributing back to the Linux community, via Arch Linux packages and hopefully pyCast as well too!<br /> </li> </ul> I think thats all for now, but i'm sure I had more.....<br /><br />In other news, listening to the radio, the International Cross has lifted their projected death toll for the Asia Tsunamis to a million, while the official count is at 125 thousand. Such a loss of life.... it's just incomprehensible, it saddens me, but mortifies me too I really hope that nothing like that occurrs in the future, and please God, not in my lifetime. Posted on Slashdot is a <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com/tsunami_gallery.html">link to some sattelite pictures of areas,</a> before and after... the damage is visible, and is just shocking.<br /><br />Also posted on Slashdot is a nice discussion of a 'new' bittorrent program, that essentially just wraps around bittorrent. Exeem, it's closed source, windows only and contains adware. Would you trust it? I wouldnt. It doesnt help that it's ugly too.<br />

     I suck at blogging, I really do.. I always forget or just whinge about something pointless...<br /><br />Anyway, I'll whinge today. Im bored. It's only 10pm so im not sleeping yet, and I dont have enough download left to play any decent games. Which sucks.<br /><br />To make it worse, theres nobody online to talk to!<br /><br />Anyway (twice i've used that already :/) The floods in southern Asia, it's just really terrible. I was watching the news, and even I just walked away, there's was much emotion, seeing people looking through photos of the dead, it's horrible. I guess it reminds us that we're still at the mercy of this planet we live on. I'm probably going to donate my next pay to the relief effort - im not really sure what else I can do........ It's all so overwhelming<br /><br />In other not-so-interesting-news-thats-pretty-interesting I started work again on PyCast.  Well, thats what im calling it today...  for those who dont know,  ala, everyone, PyCast is a podcasting client.. and for those who don't know what podcasting is..... well thats kinda just your fault. Take a looky here: http://www.ipodder.org/whatIsPodcasting<br /><br />Well thats it for the night, im out...<br /><br />iphitus<br /><br />iphitus<br />
